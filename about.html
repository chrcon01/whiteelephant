<!-- info -->
<h2 class="h2-about">THE NAME</h2>
<p class="p">The name White Elephant Pictures symbolizes the bridge between Denmark and Thailand, reflecting shared cultural r
everence and creative ambition. In Denmark, the white elephant represents the highest royal honor; in Thailand, it is a sacred symbol of wisdom and good fortune. Our name honors these values and the deep ties between our nations, rooted in over 400 years of friendship and exchange.</p>

<h2 class="h2-about">THE MISSION</h2>
<p class="p">White Elephant Pictures is a cross-cultural production company rooted in the creative synergy between Denmark and Thailand. 
Our mission is to tell bold, authentic, and emotionally resonant stories that reflect the richness of everyday lives across cultures.
We are especially committed to portraying Thailand in a deep, meaningful, and human way — far beyond clichés or surface impressions. Through close collaboration with local Thai writers, we ensure that the stories we tell are grounded in real voices, lived experiences, and cultural authenticity.
By blending Danish storytelling sensibilities with Thai creative expression, we strive to produce films that inspire, connect, and leave a lasting impact — films that carry the dignity of truth and the magic of imagination.</p>
